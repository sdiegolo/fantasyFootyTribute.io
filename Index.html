            <H2>This is a page dedicated to Fantasy Football</H2>

        <p>This is not to be confused with NFL football and it is simply called soccer in North America.<br>
          Milions of fans gather before every season begins and create leagues with friends. Simply make your own dream team with your favourite players, deploy your favourite tattic and let the fun begin!<br>
          However, you have a limited budget of "Fantasy milions" and need to ensure you buy the best players as possible within the budget. Transfer sessions are normally auction like.<br>
          Vast majority of people pay a fee to join a league even among friends. All fees are used toward the prize for the winner and runner up.<br>
          Most leagues are in Europe and cover the most prestigious football championships. Below you also find a link to the respective websites, should you want to try and register your team and/or your private league with friends:
