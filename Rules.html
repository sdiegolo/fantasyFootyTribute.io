            <H2>OK, sounds really cool...But what are the rules?</H2>

        <p>You register with your individual team in the main public competition or as part of a private league with friends in the dedicated websites you can find in the <a href="index.html">  previous page</a>.<br>Generally speaking, the rules are more or less the same across the board and according to a convention.<br>
        </p>

         <div id="teams">
          <p>Most fantasy football leagues, especially those run by national newspapers, ask participants to select 11 players within a price budget. There is usually a restriction on the number of players per club.<br> A typical selection would be to select 1 goalkeeper, 4 defenders, 4 or 3 midfielders and 2 or 3 forwards. Some games are squad-based, where participants choose not just a first eleven but also a set of substitutes. Normally you can only use max. 3 players of one team.<br>
          In smaller leagues played by a small group of people, players are bought by bidding between the rival managers rather than for a set amount of money. This means a particular player can only play for one team, and thus any points he accrues are credited to that team only. Typically, most leagues offer the chance to transfer players in and out of the team as the season progresses, in case of injury, suspension or loss of form.

         <div id="point scoring">

          <p>Points are then gained or deducted depending on players' performances. Points systems vary between games but typically, points are awarded for some or all of the following achievements:

            <ul class="leagues">

              <li class="leagues">Playing in a match (or part of a match e.g. at least 60 minutes)</li>
              <li class="leagues">Scoring a goal</li>
              <li class="leagues"> Making an assist (the pass or touch leading to the goal)</li>
              <li class="leagues">Keeping a clean sheet (goalkeepers, midfielders and defenders only)</li>
              <li class="leagues">Saving a penalty</li>  
              <li class="leagues">Goalkeeper saves 3 shots or more</li>
              <li class="leagues">Win of the team</li>

             </ul>

            </p>

          <p>As well as the above, points can be deducted for some or all of the following:</p>

         </div>

            <ul class="leagues">

              <li class="leagues">Conceding a goal (goalkeepers and defenders only)</li>
              <li class="leagues">Receiving a yellow or red card</li>
              <li class="leagues">Missing a penalty kick</li>
              <li class="leagues">Scoring an own goal</li>
              <li class="leagues">Getting substituted</li>  
              <li class="leagues">Loss of the team</li>

             </ul>
         <p>The above are the main regulations. They can vary slighly depending on the platoform and championship league you are playing.
